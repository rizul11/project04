REDUX TOOLKIT 

#It provides automatic support for redux devtools extensions.

# It provides the support for Immer.js library which automatically changes the code immutably.

# Configuring a redux store is much easier and built in support of middleware 

# A createSlice() function that comes in handy to replace create action and create Reducer functions with a single function 

# createAsyncThunk to make asynchronous requests

# Every feature is a slice
